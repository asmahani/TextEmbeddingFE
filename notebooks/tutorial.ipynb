    "The data corresponds to >800 pediatric patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Besides basic patient information (sex, age/height/weight at the time of operation), we have three additional field:\n",
    "- *diagnoses*: One or more standard diagnosis codes (including descriptions) for the patient, separated by ';'.\n",
    "- *optime*: Length of CPB operation in minutes.\n",
    "- *aki_severity*: A binary indicator of whether the patient suffered a severe form of post-operative acute kidney injury (AKI).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Options for Encoding Text\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Multivalued Binary Encoding*: Perhaps the most straightforward approach for encoding the *diagnoses* column is what can be described as *multivalued binary encoding* (MBE). We can assign a binary indicator to each individual diagnostic code, and to each patient we assign 1 to all diagnostic codes present, and 0 to the absent codes. This would be a generalzation of one-hot encoding, where multiple 1's can be present in the resulting binary vector for each observation, rather than only one.\n",
    "- *doc2vec*: [add description of gensim doc2vec, its genesis in word2vec, and its limitations]\n",
    "- *LLM embeddings*: Modern text-generating LLMs such as GPT-4 from OpenAI are deep neural networks, where the initial layers encode input text into a numeric representation. It is therefore possible to extract an embedding LLM from a text-generating LLM, followed by fine-tuning for embedding tasks. The resulting models tend to better utilize context for inferring the meaning of text and hence have improved semantic mapping in their embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM embeddings have a couple of significant properties:\n",
    "1. They are *high-dimensional*. For instance, OpenAI's *text-embedding-3-large* model returns a vector of length 3072! Directly including this long vector in predictive problems with limited data can lead to problems such as long training time and overfitting.\n",
    "2. They are *normalized*, i.e., their norm is meaningless and instead only the direction that they point in the high-dimensional space is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools offered in *TextEmbeddingFE* are designed to address the above two properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, we mention a utility function, *count_tokens*, provided in *TextEmbeddingFE* for counting the tokens in a list of strings. It returns both the maximum number of tokens in the list of strings, and the total token count. They are useful fortwo purposes:\n",
    "1. Both embedding and text-generation models from OpenAI - and likely in other LLMs - have maximum limits on token count. For instance, as of this writing, OpenAI's embedding model *text-embedding-3-large* has a maximum input length of 8191 tokens (see [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embedding-models)). By comparing the maximum number of tokens in our list against these product specifications, we can ensure that no inadvertent truncation of the data and/or error would occur.\n",
    "2. We can also use the token count to estimate the costs, since prices are often expressed per token. For OpenAI's pricing details, see [here](https://openai.com/api/pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's check the maximum and total token count for the *diagnoses* column in our data. Note that the name of OpenAI's embedding and text-generation must be specified - with default values used below - since each may use a different tokenizer library:"

    "## Predictive Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options for Using Text Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's revisit the original, predictive problem: Our goal is to predictive a binary outcome - severe postoperative AKI. Besides the `diagnoses` text field, which we seek to transform to numeric via embedding, we also have a set of *baseline* variables: patient's gender/age/height/weight, and length of operation. As for including the embedding output, we can think of a few options:\n",
    "1. Including all 3072 elements of the embedding vectors in a model alongside the baseline variables is unlikely to be an optimal strategy, as the embedding features may dominate the model and lead to overfitting, given limited number of observations (830).\n",
    "2. We can instead apply clustering to the embedding vector, as done in the explanatory path, and include the resulting cluster labels as a categorical feature in the model (which are eventually transformed into a series of binary indicators via one-hot encoding).\n",
    "3. Alternatively, we can use the embedding vectors to predict the outcome variable, and include those predictions as a synthetic feature - and alongside the baseline variables - in our final model. This is akin to the idea of stacking in ML (add ref), though here we are not technically stacking a collection of model predictions, but rather a single model prediction is being stacked on top of a collection of baseline features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last approach is what we docus on next. For more on comparing the above-mentioned approaches, see our paper (add link later). Importantly, in stacking we must use cross-validation to generate out-of-sample predictions within the training data; otherwise, we could inject a good amount of overfitting into the final model. The CV machinery and other nuances are handled in the `FeatureExtractor_Classifier` class in our package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class constructor is a thin wrapper around the `KNeighborsClassifier` class constructor from the `scikit-learn` package. While we can pass any valid arguments to the underlying class, below we only specify the number of neighbors: (we need to explain why KNN is a good choice, i.e., a flexible alternative to the rigid clusters)"
